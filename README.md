Why 1954?
---------

30 years before the title year of George Orwells infamous novel, is when most of the people who run the world were born. This was an era when Western countries had more freedom and Western governments scorned Eastern governments for their communist ideals and treatment of their own citizens. The thought that your government might be monitoring your private conversation or reading your private mail would have been shocking and unacceptable - something only evil communist governments would be capable of.

And yet here we are - welcome to 1954 if the leaders of 2014 ruled 60 years ago.

Also - shut up those commies that defend their governments oppressive actions.
